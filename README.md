# Getting Started with Open Brewery Database GUI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quickstart

To start a development build of this application locally, run the following:

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

If a new tab does not open in your default browser, open your browser of choice and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Bootstraps the dependencies required to run and build the app.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
